## This adapter helps with certain daemons (e.g. MailHog) which run in the foreground and lack the option to
## record PID files.

## usage: loco-pid-file <PID_FILE> [--] <COMMAND...>

## TODO: Guard against possibility that $PID_FILE already exists and already points to a running process.
## Not sure of a portable command for that.
